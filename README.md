# MyAJAX
One day I was viewing phtot new online and found that most of the sites did not offer AJAX - I have to reload the whole page for
the next photo. I just Completed an AJAX course that that time and I thought I may write one by myself. 
And I took 3 hours without ANY help and finished this function.

So I am able to see photos now. Maybe I need a button for next click.
